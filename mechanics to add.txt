touch mechanic: v small torched on contact points for Kam in the "same style that showing Kam will have; choppy, film grainy"


Water mechanic: water muffles sound while in it. sound can't penitrate through it. 

	water fall: while in it, radius of picking up sound is reduced, torches made in it are reduced.
	If water fall is between a sound and the player, then they can't see it.
	If a torch hits the water fall, then it stops on the water fall.
	
	can see the water always, as a rushing light grey stream.

	
	Example of hidden ledge: the ledge is actually just above Kam before she gets to the waterfall, it ends in the water fall.
	Assumption from the player would be that's it was a ceiling, and now that the waterfall signiyied the are opening up; that it was not a ledge.
	Player can stomp in the water fall to show this, either side of it they couldn't.

	OPTIONAL, MAYBE SOUND IN WATERFALLS IS FUNNELED, A BIT LIKE LIGHT, WOULD MAKE THIS XAMPLE A BIT MORE LEGIT

	diving: sound rippling off the surface of the water like light. Not a lot of sound penitrates the water.

	when dived, the background slowly darkens to show the depth they are reaching.

	can still see the top of the water, sound rippling off

	has to mainly use touch to find way round

	has to dive in one end, go down, can come up from the other.


this is more of an experience, a sensation, puzzles can be added with this.

Mainly to hid secrets? water fall stopping player from seeing a hidden ledge

alterative cove with secret while diving.
